<b>Exercises</b><br/>
Since we have some time today we might as well install a couple of the programs we'll be using during the course.<br/> They are fairly small programs, so with a little luck installing them should be quick.

I'm guessing most of you are not going to wait until I'm done talking about my slides before you start installing (even though I would recommend it), but if you can't wait then at least <b>read the instructions</b> before you install.<br/><br/>

<div style="margin-left:50px">
<b>Inkscape</b><br/>
Go to <a href="http://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">inkscape.org</a>. Click the &quot;Download Now!&quot; button, and it should then automatically give you a link to a version of Inkscape suited for your operating system. Download and run the installer. Once it's done installing, start Inkscape to check that it works.<br/><br/>Apparently, on some computers the current version of the installer doesn't install everything correctly, which will give you an error about a missing dll file when you try to start Inkscape. If that's the case for you, then run the installer again and select &quot;Repair&quot; when you get that offer. That should fix the problem, and you should be able to start Inkscape normally from now on.<br/><br/>Inkscape will most likely be set to use whatever language your computer is set to, so if you want to make my life a bit easier when at some point you might need help with the program, then you can set it to English instead. You can do that in the top menu:<br/> Edit =&gt; Preferences =&gt; Interface and then choose English in the language dropdown list.<br/><br/> 

<b>GIMP</b><br/>
Go to <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">gimp.org</a>. Click the &quot;Download&quot; button and it should suggest the version that fits your operating system. Download that and install it. When you install GIMP it will also automatically detect your regional settings and be installed in whatever language it thinks you (but probably not I) speak. So if you once again want to make my life a little easier, then the fastest way to always get it in English is to pay attention during the installation. Instead of just clicking &quot;Next&quot; to everything, actually read what it says, because at one point you can choose to &quot;Install&quot; or to &quotCustomize&quot;. If you choose to customize the installation, then you can choose exactly what to install, so unselect &quot;Translations&quot;. When you do that GIMP will be installed in English, and I might have a better chance helping you when we start using the program. When the installation is done, then start the program to check that it works.<br/>Note: If you do install all the translations, then you can still set the language of the program to English afterwards, but I will let you figure out where on your own, as a thanks for not reading all my fancy instructions.<br/><br/>

<b>Audacity</b><br/>
Go to the <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity website</a>. Click the download button that &quot;Installs with no extras&quot; to download an installer for your operating system. Then run it to install Audacity. When the installation is done, then start the program to check that it works.<br/><br/>
